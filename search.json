    "text": "Course Overview\nR is widely used for data analysis and statistics, and from a programming perspective R is weird1! The quirks of R is shocking to most programmers, but the language’s flexibility is what makes it great for statistics and data. In this three-hour workshop you’ll learn just how quirky R can be, we’ll have some fun poking around R, and you’ll leave with some useful tips and tricks for harnessing R’s oddities in your analysis or packages.\nEver wondered what a ‘closure’ is and why it isn’t subsettable? Why do we need tibble when we have data.frame? How does tidy evaluation make the tidyverse so easy to use for analysis, but so difficult to automate? Why is it good (for R) to be lazy?! I’ll answer all of these questions and more, along with any of your burning R questions.\nThis workshop is part of the WOMBAT 2024 workshop’s tutorials, and will run in-person in Melbourne on October 22nd 2024."
