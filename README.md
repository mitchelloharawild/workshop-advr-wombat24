#### Description

R is widely used for data analysis and statistics, and from a
programming perspective R is weird! The quirks of R is shocking to most
programmers, but the language’s flexibility is what makes it great for
statistics and data. In this three-hour workshop you’ll learn just how
quirky R can be, we’ll have some fun poking around R, and you’ll leave
with some useful tips and tricks for harnessing R’s oddities in your
analysis or packages.

Ever wondered what a ‘closure’ is and why it isn’t subsettable? Why do
we need tibble when we have data.frame? How does tidy evaluation make
the tidyverse so easy to use for analysis, but so difficult to automate?
Why is it good (for R) to be lazy?! I’ll answer all of these questions
and more, along with any of your burning R questions.

## Learning Outcomes

1.  Understand (and embrace) the quirks of using R
2.  Appreciate how ‘helpful’ R tries to be with vectors, recycling and
    typing
3.  Use `vctrs` to avoid common problems with vectors, recycling and
    typing
4.  Write code that writes and runs code (metaprogramming)
5.  Use non-standard evaluation for good (and evil) code design

### Format

3 hour workshop with additional 30 minute break.
